# comp20-kmimmack

This git repository is an example of my work in Tufts' Comp 20 Web Development course. This course was my first exposure to web development, and as such, much of the code given here centers around accomplishing simple tasks which utilize specific skills. 

This course has offered me a lot in terms of comp sci knowledge. I feel like I have a much better grasp on how to design for users, not just for myself. Outside of hard coding skills, I learned the importance of responsive design, protecting websites from users that can and will break your website, regardless of malicious intent, and even the necessity of designing with accessibility in mind, such as ensuring webpages are readable for colorblind individuals, optimized for visually impared users, and intuitive to senior citizens. Below is a brief summary of each assignment folder and the skills they demonstrate.

**captainslog** - JQuery, local storage

**duckhunt** - Using javascript to trim images and draw to canvas elements

**mapchat** - Google Maps API, geolocation, XMLHttpRequest. Heroku server used in assignment is no longer activiated, so gh-pages branch will no longer display live.

**messages** - XMLHTTPRequest, JSON parsing, basic CSS

**responsive** - CSS image cropping, responsive design

**security** - investigation of security vulnerabiliies such as cross-site scripting in mapchat assignment. Use of Postman software.
