# comp20-kmimmack

1. The purpose of this git repository is to have my work out and available to be able to reference and to use in a potential portfolio or example of past work.

2. My favorite lab/assignment was the Captain’s Log. I really enjoyed working with local storage, and switching to jQuery was so much nicer than working with pure javascript that it made the lab a lot more fun to complete.

3. I have definitely grown a lot in terms of comp sci knowledge. I feel like I have a much better grasp on how to design for users, not just for myself, and definitely a much better understanding of the process for getting jobs and internships.

4. The most important thing I learned was that users can and will break your website, regardless of malicious intent. One example of this was when Ming made the mapchat redirect to the Rick Roll during class. Another example of this was our Assignment 4 where we looked for vulnerabilities in each others’ servers..

5. I really want to learn more about designing for users with disabilities as well as tools for making interactive graphics with javascript
