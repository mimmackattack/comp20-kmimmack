Duck Hunt

1. The images load correctly on the screen and in the proper locations.
   What has not been implemented is the animation for the ducks.
2. I did not work with others on the project, but I did draw heavily from the
   following sources:
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Using_images
3. I spent approximately 1 hour completing the assignment.
