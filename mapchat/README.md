1. So far, geolocation works and it sends and gets location data from the given
   URL properly. Everything else has yet to be implemented.

2. Have not collaborated with anyone on the assignment. Resources used so far include:
   - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial
   for information on Google Maps API
   - https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/tree/gh-pages/examples/google_maps
   for examples and guidelines on using location with javascript
   - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation
   for information on using geolocation
   - http://www.openjs.com/articles/ajax_xmlhttp_using_post.php
   for getting HTTP Post to work

3. Spent approximately 2 hours on this assignment so far.
