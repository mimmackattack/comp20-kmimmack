1. So far, geolocation works and it sends and gets location data from the given
   URL properly. CSS has been added and Google Maps work has begun. Although the
   map will display on the page and be centered in the right location, there are
   still errors with placing markers. Everything with the markers has yet to be
   implemented.

2. Have not collaborated with anyone on the assignment. Resources used so far include:
   - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial
   for information on Google Maps API
   - https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/tree/gh-pages/examples/google_maps
   for examples and guidelines on using location with javascript
   - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation
   for information on using geolocation
   - http://www.openjs.com/articles/ajax_xmlhttp_using_post.php
   for getting HTTP Post to work
   - http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/notes/ajax.html
   for info about XMLHttpRequest and the Google Maps API

3. Spent approximately 3.5 hours on this assignment so far.
