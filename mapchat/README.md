1. Geolocation works and it sends and gets location data from the given
   URL properly. CSS has been added and Google Maps work is nearly done. Markers
   are placed and display information properly. Marker for self is unique and 
   distance info now displays properly. All requirements are implemented.
   Now also displays a loading message until map is drawn on page.
