1. So far, geolocation works and it sends and gets location data from the given
   URL properly. CSS has been added and Google Maps work is nearly done. Markers
   are placed and display information properly. Still needs more info to display
   when clicking on markers, and the spot marking yourself needs to look different.

2. Have not collaborated with anyone on the assignment. Resources used so far include:
   - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial
   for information on Google Maps API
