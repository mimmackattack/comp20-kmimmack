1. So far, the only thing that works is the geolocation. It successfully fetches
   my location and prints it out to the console. Everything else has yet to be
   implemented.

2. Have not collaborated with anyone on the assignment. Resources used so far include:
   https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial
   for information on Google Maps API
   https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/tree/gh-pages/examples/google_maps
   for examples and guidelines on using location with javascript
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation
   for information on using geolocation
   
3. Spent approximately 1 hour on this assignment so far.
