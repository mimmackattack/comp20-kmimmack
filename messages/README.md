1. The javascript works and outputs the info from the JSON file.
   It seems to interact with the HTML file fine. The only issue is that the console
   says there is a syntax error in the first line of the JSON file. Stackoverflow
   said that this is because I'm accessing a local file and that the message can be
   ignored. http://stackoverflow.com/a/18292092
   CSS is now working.

2. Did not discuss assignment with other classmates, but relied heavily upon notes
   taken in class with Carmen Sandiego example, curtosey of Ming Chow.

3. Took about two hours to complete.
